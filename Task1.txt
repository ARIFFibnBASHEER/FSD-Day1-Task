Differene between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2:

HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are both protocols used for communication between web clients (such as browsers) and web servers. 
However, they have significant differences in terms of performance, features, and how they handle communication.

1.	Multiplexing:
     HTTP/1.1 relies on multiple connections to fetch resources in parallel. 
     This leads to problems like head-of-line blocking, where a slow-loading resource can block other resources from loading. 
     HTTP/2, on the other hand, supports multiplexing within a single connection. 
     It allows multiple requests and responses to be sent and received in parallel over the same connection, thus improving efficiency and reducing latency.

2.	Header Compression:
     HTTP/1.1 headers are sent as plaintext, which can result in significant overhead, especially for requests with many small resources. 
     HTTP/2 compresses headers, reducing the amount of data transmitted and improving performance.

3.	Server Push:
     HTTP/2 introduces the concept of server push, where the server can proactively send resources to the client before they are explicitly requested. 
     This can reduce the number of round trips required to load a page, improving performance.

4.	Binary Protocol:
     While HTTP/1.1 is a text-based protocol, HTTP/2 is a binary protocol. 
     Binary protocols are more efficient to parse and can be more compact than text-based protocols, resulting in better performance.

5.	Stream Prioritization:
     HTTP/2 allows for stream prioritization, where clients can assign priority to different resources. 
     This helps in optimizing the loading of critical resources first, improving overall page load times.

6.	Connection Handling:
     HTTP/1.1 requires opening multiple connections for parallel downloads, which can lead to increased overhead due to connection setup and teardown. 
     HTTP/2 maintains a single connection per origin, reducing the overhead associated with connection management.

7.	Backward Compatibility:
     HTTP/2 is designed to be fully backward compatible with HTTP/1.1. 
     This means that even if a client or server only supports HTTP/1.1, communication can still occur, although without the performance benefits of HTTP/2 features like multiplexing and header compression.

Overall, HTTP/2 offers significant performance improvements over HTTP/1.1, especially in scenarios where multiple resources need to be fetched to load a web page. 
However, adoption of HTTP/2 may require updates to both client and server software.
